# Atomos

**A lightweight retexture of Vite focused on simplicity and clean structure.**

---

> ⚠️ **Important — package.json reset issue**
>
> Some environments or tools may regenerate `package.json` when renaming the project folder or reinitializing. This can reset fields like name and scripts.
>
> **Solution:** If this happens, restore your configuration manually or revert using version control. 
> Refer to the [Source Package.json](https://github.com/Atomos-Js/Atomos/blob/main/package.json).

## What Atomos Is

Atomos is a minimal React development environment built on top of Vite.  
It keeps Vite’s fast engine but applies streamlined defaults, cleaner structure, and custom branding with **Tailwind CSS Pre-included**.

It’s not a new bundler.  
It’s a **refined experience**.

---

## Why It Exists

Atomos exists to:

- **Reduce Noise:** Stripped-back configuration for immediate focus.
- **Clean Structure:** An opinionated, minimalist file hierarchy.
- **Instant Styling:** Tailwind CSS is pre-configured and optimized.
- **Agile Workflow:** High-impact development with zero clutter.

Instead of rebuilding tooling from scratch, Atomos focuses on refining what already works well.
